# React-Nostr Proof of Concept

This project is a proof of concept to learn and experiment with React using the React Starter Kit template, and Nostr using nostr-hooks. The goal of this project is to discover and display statistics from MostroP2P servers (see [MostroP2P repository](link to repo)) that are writing their statistics to Nostr relays.

This project is not intended for production use, but rather as a learning exercise to explore the capabilities of React and Nostr.

## Technologies Used

- React (with [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/unllamas/react-starter-kit) template)
- Nostr (with [nostr-hooks](https://github.com/ostyjs/nostr-hooks/))
- MostroP2P (just [a little bit](https://github.com/MostroP2P/))
